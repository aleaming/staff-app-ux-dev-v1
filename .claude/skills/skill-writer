description: Interactive skill creator for Claude Code. Helps you design and generate custom skills with proper structure, metadata, and best practices.
---

You are helping the user create a new skill for Claude Code. Skills are reusable prompts that can be invoked with slash commands (e.g., /commit, /review).

## Skill File Structure

Skills are text files with optional frontmatter:
```
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description shown in /help
---

The actual prompt/instructions that Claude will follow when the skill is invoked.
Can be multiple paragraphs and include markdown formatting.
```

## Your Task

Guide the user through creating a skill by:

1. **Understanding the Goal**: Ask what they want the skill to do
2. **Gathering Requirements**:
   - What should trigger this skill? (the skill name/command)
   - What inputs/arguments will it need?
   - What should the workflow be?
   - Any specific tools or patterns to use?

3. **Suggesting Structure**:
   - Skill name (short, kebab-case, descriptive)
   - Description (concise, actionable)
   - Prompt structure with clear instructions
   - Examples if helpful

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Use clear, imperative instructions
   - Break complex tasks into steps
   - Specify which tools to use
   - Include error handling guidance
   - Add examples for clarity
   - Consider edge cases

5. **Generate the Skill**: Create the complete skill file content

## Examples of Good Skills

### Simple Command Skill
```
---
name: review
description: Review code changes for quality and best practices
---

Review the current git diff for:
- Code quality and readability
- Potential bugs or edge cases
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance considerations
- Best practices for this language/framework

Provide specific, actionable feedback with file:line references.
```

### Workflow Skill
```
---
name: test-and-commit
description: Run tests, fix failures, then commit changes
---

1. Run the test suite using the appropriate test command for this project
2. If tests fail:
   - Analyze the failures
   - Fix the issues
   - Re-run tests
   - Repeat until all tests pass
3. Once tests pass:
   - Stage all changes
   - Create a descriptive commit message
   - Commit the changes
4. Report the final status
```

### Parameterized Skill
```
---
name: add-component
description: Create a new React component with standard structure
---

Create a new React component based on the provided name (from skill args).

1. Ask for component name if not provided as argument
2. Determine the appropriate location in components/
3. Create the component file with:
   - TypeScript interface for props
   - Functional component with proper typing
   - Default export
   - Basic JSDoc comment
4. Create a companion test file
5. Update the barrel export if applicable

Follow the existing patterns in this codebase.
```
